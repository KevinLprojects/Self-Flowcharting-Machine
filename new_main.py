# overview of goal for user interface:

# features:
    # create flowchart for code
    # run code in graph form and calculate stats (not sure what that mean yet)
    # compile flowchart back to code (either by looking at what was run when running it from nodes, or directly converting flowchart to code)

    # longer term features:
        # interactive flowchart (pygame?)
        # natural languege to code (per node)
        # compile user created or edited flowchart to code (flowchart representation needs to handle non displaying keywords: else, pass, with, try (sort of), except, finally, etc..)

# usage sudo code:

# parse text
# create blocks
# create graph nodes
# connect the nodes
